###### Motivation  

```
I started my programing journey at 42 Lisboa (as you already may have noticed) and  
through this path, of peer-to-per learning, with no teachers, and no recomended text  
books, the library of our own choosing is open for individual creation.  
As I came across important online documents worth keeping I decided to  
archive them for future reading/reference and to share the findings with my   
collegues, for debate and educational purposes.  
Enjoy the reading ðŸ‘½
